# 🚆 Rail Fall Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting potential rail fall incidents using machine learning models trained on structured data. It utilizes the CatBoost classifier for optimal performance and includes a Streamlit-based web app for real-time predictions.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Railway tracks can be affected by various structural and environmental factors, leading to fall incidents that endanger lives and disrupt services. This project aims to predict such failures based on key features, helping maintenance teams act proactively.

## 🛠️ Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and outliers
- Encoded categorical features
- Scaled numerical features
- Balanced the dataset using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)

### 2. Model Building
- Compared multiple machine learning models:
  - ✅ CatBoost (Best Performance)
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Machine

### 3. Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

### 4. Deployment
- Saved the best-performing model (`best_catboost_model.pkl`)
- Deployed using Streamlit for user interaction and prediction
